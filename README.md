# Personalisation of offers based on user clustering

Analyzed customer behavior and revenue patterns to help businesses refine their strategies. Leveraged statistical analysis, K-means clustering, DBSCAN clustering, and frequent item sets to extract actionable insights. The project focused on enabling personalized marketing, optimizing promotional campaigns, and improving customer engagement through data-driven approaches.

As the analysis showed, the offers add up to about 15% of the revenue. The number of completed offers is
weakly correlated with the normal transaction amount per customer, which can be caused by the simple
fact, that more active customers complete offers instead of making regular purchases. The offers have a completion rate of 50-75% which suggests that the company uses appropriate methods of targeting.

Both the distribution of numbers of users and revenues they bring suggest that the company should focus
on users 55+. Female customers are less numerous than male, but they generate higher total revenue and
have higher revenue per person value.

As the frequent item analysis indicates, any pair of offers has similar chance to be completed together
(between 6 and 10%).

K-means and BDscan clustering methods did not provide any significant insights in the data, as user
characteristics do not have any separation into meaningful groups. Furthermore, no attributes can be
concluded to predict the customer profitability for the company.
